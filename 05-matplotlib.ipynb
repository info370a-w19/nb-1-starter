    "In Python, the `matplotlib` package is the leading static visualization package (you can think of it as Python's `ggplot2`). This notebook will walk you through some of the basics of plotting with `matplotlib` (a popular graphics package). As you complete this notebook, I **strongly suggest** that you read [this chapter](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html) in the _Python Data Science Handbook_, which describes the package in detail (you will need to read it to identify the appropriate syntax)."

    "# Web scraping\n",
    "A common data collection task is to collect data from web pages and transform them into an analysis ready format. In this exercise, you'll be scraping the [Informatics Course Information](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/info.html) page to ask some basic questions about the courses offered. To do so, we'll be using the [beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) package, which should have been included as part of the Anaconda python distribtuion. A great starting place for understanding the package is [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/)."

Variable names should be expressive, and be written as lower-case words that are underscore separated (i.e., `variable_name`). For more information on the basics of working with variables, see [this section](https://info370a-w19.github.io/python-basics/introduction-to-python.html#variables) of the _Python Basics_ online book."

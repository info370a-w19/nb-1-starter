    "# Pandas Basics\n",
    "In python, the `pandas` package is the most popular data-frame (i.e., 2-dimensional) manipulation framework. You can think of it like `dplyr` for python. This notebook will walk you through some of the basics of working with dataframes. As you complete this notebook, I **strongly suggest** that you read [this chapter](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) in the _Python Data Science Handbook_, which describes the package in detail (you will need to read it to identify the appropriate syntax)."

    "Let's create a dataframe representing 1000 houses that has the following columns:\n",
    "- `house_id`: This should be `\"house_N\"`, where `N` is the house number (i.e., `house_1`)\n",
    "- `neighborhood`: There should be 5 neighborhoods, `\"a\"` through `\"e\"` (200 of each)\n",
    "- `price_2010`: The price (in USD) of the house in 2010 (can be _float_)\n",
    "- `price_2018`: The price (in USD) of the house in 2010 (can be _float_)\n",
